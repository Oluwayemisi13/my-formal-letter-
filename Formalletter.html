<p> <h3>Good day sir,</h3></p>
<p><h3>I am writing to complain about some equipment we lack in our classroom.
<p>We want you to provide some equipment for us so that the class will be lively these are our requirements;
<p>
<ol>
<li>marker</li>
<li>chairs</li>
<li>tables</li>
<li>a new white board</li>
<li> an mp3</li>
</ol>
<p>Further more, I will be happy and glad if you can consider and accept our requests because some of our classmates didn't have where to sit they will have to wait for others to finish class before they can have there own sit.</p>
